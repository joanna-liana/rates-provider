# Rates Provider

Mini-project for [Pisz lepsze testy](https://szkolatestow.online/lepsze-testy)

## Week 3

The focus of this week wasn't that much on testing itself, but more on using shortcuts and snippets to speed up work.

Additionally, I paid attention to proper Money implementation.

## Week 4
The challenge here was to use my own stub and mock, and then use the ones provided by an external library. In order to have some code to test against, I updated the RatesProvider so that it uses a Rates API and played around with a real HTTP API (but used the in-memory version in tests).
